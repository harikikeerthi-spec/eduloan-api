        IMPORTANT: For the "rank" field, use the Webometrics Ranking (https://webometricsranking.com/) 
        which provides the most comprehensive world universities ranking based on web presence and impact.
        Format the rank as "#123" (e.g. #5, #42, #150).
        
        If specific program rankings are available (e.g. QS subject rankings, US News program rankings), 
        include them in parentheses like "#42 (CS: #15)" where CS is the program ranking.
        
        Provide program-specific data where applicable:
        - Tuition should be specific to the mentioned program if different
        - Acceptance rate for the specific program
        - Average salary for graduates of that specific program
        - Include any program-specific strengths or specializations
        
        Provide the comparison data in the following JSON format:
        {
            "uni1": {
                "name": "Full Name of ${uni1}",
                "rank": "Webometrics Rank (e.g. #5 or #42 (${program1}: #15))",

                "rate": "Acceptance Rate for ${program1 || 'this program'} (e.g. 5%)",

                "rank": "Webometrics Rank (e.g. #8 or #55 (${program2}: #20))",

        Be accurate with latest available data. Use Webometrics (https://webometricsranking.com/) for world rankings.
        If program-specific data is not available, provide university-wide data but note it in the response.
